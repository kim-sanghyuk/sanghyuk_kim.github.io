I have started my Ph.D. in the [Smart Design Lab (SDL)](https://www.smartdesignlab.org/) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/) under the supervision of Professor [Namwoo Kang](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?hl=en&user=tYU_Cz0AAAAJ).

I am excited to embark on this new journey, focusing on cutting-edge research in design optimization and data-driven design methodologies.
